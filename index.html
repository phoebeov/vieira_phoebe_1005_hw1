  <div id="lifeText"> <p> Hi I'm Phoebe. <br> Welcome to my life.</p>
  <p>I was born on January 25th, 19 years ago to an English woman and a Barbadian
    man. I've got a younger sister, three dogs and a cat. My mum started visiting
    Barbados annually when she was a young girl with her family and fell in love
    with the island. My parents had mutual friends and met at a Christmas party
    in their twenties. Years later they became friends, business partners and
    then husband and wife.

  <p>I've always been a lover of school. I love to learn. Love to know things.
    Love to succeed. I am my biggest critic and push myself to the limit. I like
    to be good at things. <br> I first started school when I was two years old at
    First Steps in Barbaods, which laid the foundation for my core group of friends.
    <br> From there I moved to St. Winifred's School with my best friends from kindergarten.
    I spent twelve years of my academic life at that school and graduated in 2014 at
    the equivalent of Grade 10. After that, I packed up and moved to Canada to attend
    Appleby College, a boarding school in Oakville. Appleby gave me two of the greatest
    years of my life and I am forever grateful. Finally I moved to Western University
    and was enrolled in the MTP program. At first I hated my new school. It was far too big.
    I hated not being able to recognize people on the way to class. I hated being a unit, a nameless
    face within a packed out lecture hall. I was miserable. This year I couldn't be happier
    at Fanshawe - although I may not know all the names, I am able to recognize all the faces
    of the kids who spend each class with me. They understand what I'm going through, they take
    the same courses as I do. We have the same work loads. It works. I love that I can ask a question
    when I am confused, which is often. I love that my teachers know my name. I love that I
    have regained an identity, as opposed to being "just another student".
